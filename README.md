Backend:
Python (Numpy, Pandas)
Scikit-learn (for vectorization and similarity calculation)
Frontend:
Streamlit (for creating the web interface)
How It Works üöÄ
Data Preprocessing: Extracts movie metadata such as cast, director, and genre to create a tag for each movie.
Vectorization: The metadata is transformed into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.
Similarity Calculation: Cosine similarity is applied to find movies that are most similar to the one the user has input.
Recommendations: The system displays movies with the highest similarity scores based on the input provided by the user.
